## Archival notice
Nowadays the Windows settings allow changing network type, so this programm isn't needed anymore.

## WindowsNetworkTypeSwitcher
A small wpf windows application to change to network type to either private, public or domain.

I created this as in the past it wasn't possible to (easily) change the network type without manually changing registry entries.
