## Archival notice
I created this as in the past it wasn't possible to (easily) change the network type without manually changing registry entries.

But nowadays the Windows settings allow exactly that, so this programm isn't needed anymore.

## WindowsNetworkTypeSwitcher
A small wpf windows application to change to network type to either private, public or domain.
